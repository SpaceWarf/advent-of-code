# Advent of Code 2020
My repository of solutions for the 2020 Advent of Code. The puzzles can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

The solutions were developped using [Quokka](https://quokkajs.com/) as a live Javascript playground. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) unit tests are included for every solution and utility function in the project.
